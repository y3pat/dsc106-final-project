        <h2>Welcome to StressScape!</h2>
        <p>This interactive visualization explores how stress impacts the body during a series of tests 
          designed to mimic real college-life pressures—exams, deadlines, and those moments when you feel 
          like you’re barely holding it together. Mirroring the challenges faced by many college students 
          such as yourself, we begin with your baseline state, then move through various tests that simulate
           cognitive overload, public scrutiny, and rapid mental calculations. By understanding these patterns, 
           you can gain insights into your own stress responses and learn to manage them better.

      <section class="step fade-in" data-test="baseline">
        <h2>Baseline: The Calm Before the Storm</h2>
        <p>In the Baseline phase, you’re asked simply to relax. Although it might seem like a moment of calm, the anticipation of what’s to come can already elevate your stress levels. Many students feel nervous even before the first test begins. Here, we see your initial heart rate start high—as a sign of anticipatory anxiety—then gradually decrease as you follow instructions to relax. Your initially erratic EDA begins to stabilize as you calm yourself. This phase serves as your reference point, setting the stage for the stress-induced changes that follow.</p>
        <!-- <h3>👀 POV: You</h3>
        <p>It's Sunday night. You’re feeling fresh, motivated, and totally **ready** to have a productive week. 
        You swear you’re going to keep up with your readings *this time.*</p> -->
      </section>
      <section class="step fade-in" data-test="stroop">
        <h2>Stroop Test: When Your Brain Betrays You</h2>
        <p>The Stroop Test challenges your brain by forcing you to name the color of a word rather than reading the word itself. This creates a conflict between your automatic reading habits and the task at hand. Imagine being in class when a sudden change in exam instructions leaves you momentarily paralyzed. In this phase, you may not see a spike in your heart rate but you begin to see a steady increase in skin conductance as your brain works overtime to resolve the conflict. It’s a direct reflection of the cognitive dissonance you might experience during unexpected academic challenges.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="step fade-in" data-test="first_rest">
        <h2>First Rest: The Fake Break</h2>
        <p>After the mental onslaught of the Stroop Test, you’re given a break. But if you observe the graphs, the recovery isn’t instantaneous—the skin conductance only starts to fall slowly. Meanwhile, your heart rate may actually increase as your mind prepares to put yourself through another stress-inducing test. This “fake break” is all too familiar: you think you’re resting, but your body is still in high alert mode, echoing that all-too-common scenario when you try to unwind between assignments yet still feel the residual pressure.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="step fade-in" data-test="tmct">
        <h2>TMCT: The Math Trauma Test</h2>
        <p>The TMCT (Trier Mental Challenge Test) is designed to simulate a high-pressure, timed academic task. The graph shows a pronounced increase in stress markers as you tackle rapid math problems under a tight deadline. This phase mimics those moments in exams when every second counts and your body responds with erratic electrodermal activity, reflecting the intense pressure of performing under time constraints.</p>
        
      </section>
      <section class="step fade-in" data-test="second_rest">
        <h2>Second Rest: Stress Aftermath</h2>
        <p>After the TMCT, you have another rest period. Unlike the previous rest, you start to get used to the workload and you begin to steady yourself in preparation for the next task. The graphs illustrate that in your physiological responses, which become steady due to the lack of a major task.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="step fade-in" data-test="real_opinion">
        <h2>Real Opinion: Speaking Up Under Pressure</h2>
        <p>Expressing your genuine thoughts in a public setting can be surprisingly stressful. The graph here reflects a moderate yet sustained increase in stress markers as you confront the vulnerability of speaking up. It’s akin to that uneasy feeling during a class debate or a job interview when you have to share your true opinions under scrutiny. The data visually underscores that this isn’t just mental stress—it’s a full-body response.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="step fade-in" data-test="rest_between_tests_1">
        <h2>Rest Between Tests 1 - Cumulative Fatigue</h2>
        <p>Even during a brief break, your body might not fully recover if the stress from previous tests lingers. The graph shows that your heart rate and skin conductance remain somewhat elevated. This phase reminds you of the times you take a “quick break” between assignments only to realize that your body hasn’t fully reset from earlier pressures.</p>

      </section>
      <section class="step fade-in" data-test="opposite_opinion">
        <h2>Opposite Opinion - The Strain of Cognitive Dissonance</h2>
        <p>In this phase, you’re forced to argue a point you don’t necessarily agree with—an exercise that creates internal conflict. The graph reflects a subtle yet distinct shift in your physiological signals. This is the stress of cognitive dissonance: it’s not as dramatic as a timed test, but it’s a constant, nagging pressure that adds to your overall stress load.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="step fade-in" data-test="rest_between_tests_2">
        <h2>Rest Between Tests 2 – Incomplete Recovery Continues</h2>
        <p>Another short rest follows, yet the graphs show that your recovery remains partial. The sustained elevated levels indicate that when stressors come one after the other, there isn’t enough time for your body to return fully to its calm state. This mirrors those moments when, despite taking a break, you can’t shake off the tension from back-to-back demands.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="step fade-in" data-test="subtract_test">
        <h2>Subtract Test - Rapid Calculation Under Duress</h2>
        <p>The Subtract Test requires you to perform quick, high-pressure mental arithmetic. The graph displays a sudden, sharp increase in stress markers that reflects the intense anxiety of having to compute on the fly. Think of it as that nerve-wracking moment when you’re unexpectedly asked a math question in class—the data shows your body’s immediate response to that acute stress.</p>
      </section>      
      <section class="step fade-in" data-test="post_experiment">
        <h2>Post Experiment: Stress Reflection</h2>
        <p>In the final phase, the graphs begin to show a trend toward normalization. This stage captures the process of recovery after a long series of stress tests. It’s a reflective moment—an opportunity to see how your body gradually returns to a resting state. While some stress indicators may remain slightly elevated, this phase emphasizes that recovery is possible and that understanding these patterns can help you better manage your stress over time.</p>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Stress is an inherent part of college life, but by visualizing your body's responses, StressScape transforms this invisible burden into a comprehensible narrative. Recognizing how your heart rate and skin conductance shift during these common college experiences empowers you to develop strategies to manage stress more effectively. This journey isn’t just about data—it’s about understanding yourself and taking control of your well-being. With that being said, let's play a little game...</p>
