        <h2>Welcome to StressScape</h2>
        <p>College is a chaotic mix of exams, deadlines, job hunting, and the existential dread of pretending to have your life together. 
          But have you ever wondered **how stress actually affects you**? 
          This interactive journey breaks down the science behind stress—one painfully relatable scenario at a time.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="step fade-in" data-test="baseline">
        <h2>Baseline: The Calm Before the Storm</h2>
        <p>Before stress kicks in, your body is at rest. Heart rate? Normal. Brain? Functioning. 
        This is your **starting point** before chaos takes over.</p>
        <h3>👀 POV: You</h3>
        <p>It's Sunday night. You’re feeling fresh, motivated, and totally **ready** to have a productive week. 
        You swear you’re going to keep up with your readings *this time.*</p>
      </section>
      <section class="step fade-in" data-test="stroop">
        <h2>Stroop Test: When Your Brain Betrays You</h2>
        <p>This test forces you to name the **color** of a word, rather than reading the word itself. 
        Sounds easy? Try saying the **color of the word "RED" when it's written in blue ink.** 
        Your brain has to fight its instincts, and this cognitive conflict increases stress levels.</p>
        <h3>👀 POV: You</h3>
        <p>Your professor just changed the exam format. You’re **rereading the same sentence 10 times**, but nothing is processing.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="step fade-in" data-test="first_rest">
        <h2>First Rest: The Fake Break</h2>
        <p>After mental overload, your body tries to recover. But stress doesn’t always disappear immediately.</p>
        <h3>👀 POV: You</h3>
        <p>You take a *"quick break"* before studying. Next thing you know, it's **three hours later**, 
        and you’re deep in a conspiracy theory rabbit hole on TikTok.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="step fade-in" data-test="tmct">
        <h2>TMCT: The Math Trauma Test</h2>
        <p>(actually called the Trier Mental Challenge Test)
        A timed math challenge under pressure. 
        Nothing says "fun" like solving equations while your brain actively tries to shut down.</p>
        <h3>👀 POV: You</h3>
        <p>You open your exam, and the first question is: **“What is 17 × 8?”**  
        Your brain: **"Blue?"**</p>
      </section>
      <section class="step fade-in" data-test="second_rest">
        <h2>Second Rest: Stress Aftermath</h2>
        <p>Even after the challenge is over, your stress doesn’t immediately fade. 
        This phase tracks how long it takes to calm down.</p>
        <h3>👀 POV: You</h3>
        <p>You walk out of the exam pretending to be fine, but internally, you’re still replaying **every question you got wrong.**</p>
      </section>
      <section class="step fade-in" data-test="real_opinion">
        <h2>Real Opinion: Speaking Up Under Pressure</h2>
        <p>Public speaking, class discussions, or job interviews—expressing yourself under scrutiny is its own form of stress.</p>
        <h3>👀 POV: You</h3>
        <p>Your professor randomly calls on you: **"What do you think?"** 
        Your **soul leaves your body.**</p>
      </section>
      <section class="step fade-in" data-test="rest_between_tests_1">
        <h2>Rest Between Tests 1</h2>
        <p>Sometimes, a break isn’t really a break. Your body is still processing the stress from the last challenge, 
        and you’re already bracing yourself for the next one.</p>
        <h3>👀 POV: You</h3>
        <p>You close your laptop after finishing an assignment, but your mind immediately jumps to the next deadline. 
        You’re not resting, you’re just waiting for the next wave.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="step fade-in" data-test="opposite_opinion">
        <h2>Opposite Opinion: Debating Against Yourself</h2>
        <p>Ever had to argue for a position you don’t believe in? Welcome to the stress of cognitive dissonance.</p>
        <h3>👀 POV: You</h3>
        <p>You’re in a group project. Someone says, **"I think we should all do equal work."** 
        You have to pretend to agree.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="step fade-in" data-test="rest_between_tests_2">
        <h2>Rest Between Tests 2</h2>
        <p>Another short break—but is it enough? With stress accumulating, 
        this is the moment when fatigue can start taking over.</p>
        <h3>👀 POV: You</h3>
        <p>You tell yourself you’ll get 8 hours of sleep tonight. Then, suddenly, it’s 2 AM and you’re still awake, scrolling.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="step fade-in" data-test="subtract_test">
        <h2>Subtract Test: The Countdown to Doom</h2>
        <p>Quick math, under pressure—like when a professor asks for calculations mid-lecture.</p>
        <h3>👀 POV: You</h3>
        <p>Professor: **"What’s 256 divided by 8?"** 
        You: **"Uhhhhhhh…"**</p>
      </section>      
      <section class="step fade-in" data-test="post_experiment">
        <h2>Post Experiment: Stress Reflection</h2>
        <p>Now that all the stress tests are done, we can see how stress levels fluctuated. 
        Did they spike? Recover? Linger?</p>
        <h3>👀 POV: You</h3>
        <p>You survived. Barely. But at what cost?</p>
      </section>
      <section class="step fade-in conclusion-step" data-test="conclusion">
        <h2>Final Thoughts: So, Now What?</h2>
        <p>Stress is unavoidable, but **how you handle it** is what matters. Recognizing stress patterns 
        helps you develop strategies to manage them effectively.</p>
        <h3>👀 POV: You</h3>
        <p>You now have **scientific proof** that being a college student is objectively stressful. 
        But hey, at least you’re not alone in it.</p>
