        <h2>Welcome to StressScape</h2>
        <p>College is a chaotic mix of exams, deadlines, job hunting, and the existential dread of pretending to have your life together. 
          But have you ever wondered <em>how stress actually affects you</em>? 
          This interactive journey breaks down the science behind stress—one painfully relatable scenario at a time.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="step fade-in" data-test="baseline">
        <h2>Baseline: The Calm Before the Storm</h2>
        <p>Before stress kicks in, your body is at rest. Heart rate? Normal. Brain? Functioning. 
        This is your <em>starting point</em> before chaos takes over.</p>
        <h3>POV:</h3>
        <p>It's Sunday night. You’re feeling fresh, motivated, and <em>totally ready to have a productive week</em>. 
        You swear you’re going to keep up with your readings <em>this time</em>...</p>
      </section>
      <section class="step fade-in" data-test="stroop">
        <h2>Stroop Test: When Your Brain Betrays You</h2>
        <p>This test forces you to name the <em>color</em> of a word, rather than reading the word itself. 
        Sounds easy? Try saying the <em>color of the word "RED" when it's written in blue ink.</em>
        Your brain has to fight its instincts, and this cognitive conflict increases stress levels.</p>
        <h3>POV:</h3>
        <p>Your professor just changed the exam format. You’re <em>rereading the same sentence 10 times</em>, but nothing is processing.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="step fade-in" data-test="first_rest">
        <h2>First Rest: The Fake Break</h2>
        <p>After mental overload, your body tries to recover. But stress doesn’t always disappear immediately.</p>
        <h3>POV:</h3>
        <p>You take a "quick break" before studying. Next thing you know, it's <em>three hours later</em>, 
        and you’re deep in a conspiracy theory rabbit hole on TikTok.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="step fade-in" data-test="tmct">
        <h2>TMCT: The Math Trauma Test</h2>
        <p>(actually called the Trier Mental Challenge Test)
        A timed math challenge under pressure. 
        Nothing says "fun" like solving equations while your brain actively tries to shut down.</p>
        <h3>POV:</h3>
        <p>You open your exam, and the first question is: <em>“What is 17 × 8?”</em>  
        Your brain: "Blue?"</p>
      </section>
      <section class="step fade-in" data-test="second_rest">
        <h2>Second Rest: Stress Aftermath</h2>
        <p>Even after the challenge is over, your stress doesn’t immediately fade. 
        This phase tracks how long it takes to calm down.</p>
        <h3>POV:</h3>
        <p>You walk out of the exam pretending to be fine, but internally, you’re still replaying <em>every question you got wrong.</em></p>
      </section>
      <section class="step fade-in" data-test="real_opinion">
        <h2>Real Opinion: Speaking Up Under Pressure</h2>
        <p>Public speaking, class discussions, or job interviews—expressing yourself under scrutiny is its own form of stress.</p>
        <h3>POV:</h3>
        <p>Your professor randomly calls on you: <em>"What do you think?"</em> 
        Your <em>soul leaves your body.</em></p>
      </section>
      <section class="step fade-in" data-test="rest_between_tests_1">
        <h2>Rest Between Tests 1</h2>
        <p>Sometimes, a break isn’t really a break. Your body is still processing the stress from the last challenge, 
        and you’re already bracing yourself for the next one.</p>
        <h3>POV:</h3>
        <p>You close your laptop after finishing an assignment, but your mind immediately jumps to the next deadline. 
        You’re not resting, you’re just waiting for the next wave.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="step fade-in" data-test="opposite_opinion">
        <h2>Opposite Opinion: Debating Against Yourself</h2>
        <p>Ever had to argue for a position you don’t believe in? Welcome to the stress of cognitive dissonance.</p>
        <h3>POV:</h3>
        <p>You’re in a group project and somehow got assigned to defend <em>why pineapple belongs on pizza</em> even though you <em>hate</em> pineapple on pizza.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="step fade-in" data-test="rest_between_tests_2">
        <h2>Rest Between Tests 2</h2>
        <p>Another short break—but is it enough? With stress accumulating, 
        this is the moment when fatigue can start taking over.</p>
        <h3>POV:</h3>
        <p>You tell yourself you’ll get 8 hours of sleep tonight. Then, suddenly, it’s 2 AM and you’re still awake, scrolling.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="step fade-in" data-test="subtract_test">
        <h2>Subtract Test: The Countdown to Doom</h2>
        <p>Quick math, under pressure—like when a professor asks for calculations mid-lecture.</p>
        <h3>POV:</h3>
        <p>Professor: <em>"What’s 256 divided by 8?"</em>
        You: <em>"Uhhhhhhh…"</em></p>
      </section>      
      <section class="step fade-in" data-test="post_experiment">
        <h2>Post Experiment: Stress Reflection</h2>
        <p>Now that all the stress tests are done, we can see how stress levels fluctuated. 
        Did they spike? Recover? Linger?</p>
        <h3>POV:</h3>
        <p>You survived. Barely. But at what cost?</p>
      </section>
      <section class="step fade-in conclusion-step" data-test="conclusion">
        <h2>Final Thoughts: So, Now What?</h2>
        <p>Stress is unavoidable, but <em>how you handle it</em> is what matters. Recognizing stress patterns 
        helps you develop strategies to manage them effectively.</p>
        <h3>POV:</h3>
        <p>You now have <em>scientific proof</em> that being a college student is objectively stressful. 
        But hey, at least you’re not alone in it.</p>
